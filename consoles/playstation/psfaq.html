<h1>What is PLAYSTATION</h1>
The Sony Playstation, aka PS-X, is the initial video gaming console by
electronics giant, the Sony Corporation of Japan. The Sony Playstation has been
admittedly been in development for the last 2 or 2.5 years - remember the SNES
CD!? (<a href="#psxhistory">see history</a>) Development included both working with LSI Technologies and 
creating a video game/electronic media department, known as the Sony Computer
Entertainment of Japan (SCE)<p>

The Playstation is the initial hardware entry by the Sony Corp. into 
the video gaming arena. Anticipation of the Playstation is high, as well as its
expected retail success; although selling the projected 3 million in the 
first year is quite optimistic though ;)<p>

The Playstation is set to compete against the 'next generation' of 
consoles, which include: 3DO; 3DO M2; Sega 32X; Sega Saturn; Atari Jaguar; 
Atari Jaguar II (whenever it DOES arrive); Atari Jaguar CD; Nintedo Ultra 64; 
and the rumored Amiga PA-RISC system.<p>

Technically, the Playstation is a 32-bit RISC, CD-ROM/XA2 based video
game console.  The Playstation is capable of spectacular graphic effects that
include: high volume of texture-mapped polygons, incredible sprite renditions, 
hardware tri-axial rotation, gorraurd shading, among others.  Although 3D is
seemingly stressed in the majority of the scheduled games, and in the 
RendorMorphics graphical libraries, there is a built-in 2D background and
sprite engine (<a href="#psxspecs">see specs</a>) Also, instead of having on board RAM for saving 
game positions and games; Sony Corp. opted for a 'Neo-Geoish' option, they are
utilizing memory cards (<a href="#psxspecs">see specs</a>).<p>

<a name="psxhistory">
<h1>The PLAYSTATION history</h1>
The Sony Playstation actually has a history... a quite controversial 
one at that.  The Playstation is the product of the un-consummated relationship
between the Sony Corp. and Nintendo of Japan. The Playstation was the name and
designation of the <vaporware> SNES CD-ROM.  NOJ and the Sony Corp. briefly 
combined in a joint effort in order to create a CD-ROM peripheral for the 
SNES; for the purpose of competing with the Sega-CD. However, NOJ suddenly
defaulted on the agreement and re-announced the SNES CD, to be developed by
Phillips Electronics; an European corporation. This version of the SNES CD 
never came to fruition, and the Sony Corp. was stuck with a working model of 
the SNES CD; known as the Playstation.<p>

During the time that the Sony Corp. did work with Nintendo of 
Japan, which was stated to be only a month, but in all actuality was 
longer than that (how long, I really do not know); but the Sony Corp. did 
have three variations of the Playstation up and running: one was the 
add-on, or SNES CD, one was a 'stand-alone' version, and another was a 
chipset that could be re-manufactured by anybody that licensed it.  These 
versions had a NEC V800 chip, not the RISC R3000A chip in the released 
version of the Sony Playstation.<p>

What to do!? Well, the Sony Corp. enhanced it, combined with LSI 
Logic for chip design(s), and are ready to finally release it into 
competition with the 'next generation' consoles; with its sights set primarily
upon the Nintendo Ultra 64, 3DO, and Sega Saturn.<p>

<a name="psxsupport">
<h1>PLAYSTATION SUPPORT</h1>
Supporting the Sony Plastation are a number quality software
developers. This list includes: Konami, Capcom, Technosoft, Namco, Taito, 
Time Warner Interactive, SunSoft, Virgin, UBI Soft, and Takara. Also included
on this list is the newly formed Sony Computer Entertainment of Japan (SCE);
expect some great titles from these guys (Europe and Japan).<p>

<a name="psxcompatible">
<h1>PLAYSTATION COMPATIBILITY</h1>
<b>Will the American, Japanese, and European Playstation be compatible!?</b><p>
Unfortunately, the answer to this question is no... Sony, and Sega, 
announced that there will be territorial lock-outs implemented on the Sony
Playstation (and Sega Saturn).  However, it is unknown whether or not this 
lock-out will be hardware or software... but, rumors that the Sony Corp. 
has yet to answer specify that the lock-out announcement was/is just a 
ploy to stop, or at least slow down, importing...<p>
