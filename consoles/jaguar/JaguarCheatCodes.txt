press the keys in order, without holding them down after they've been 
pressed.

hold the keys in order.  Unless instructed otherwise, don't release the

JAGUAR GENERAL TRICKS (JGT)

and release Pause+Option before the letters start to fall), then:
     Zoom In     Up
     Zoom Out    Down

ALIEN VS PREDATOR (AVP)

After entering the Cheat II code, using the Toggle Cheat command will give 
you unlimited life and ammo (the ammo bars will run down, then refresh 
themselves; the energy bar will run down to zero and stop).  To get 
unlimited ammo, you must already have some ammo in the weapon.  The Up/Down 
Level commands cycle through each sublevel, both alien ships, and all the 
air vents.  This cheat works with all characters.

     Press Option.
     Press 1+3.
     Release Pause.
     Press Option.
     Shotgun blast confirms.

coordinates (in hexadecimal).  "1(nn)" is the current level.

Freeze Alien Queen:
     Anywhere inside the Queen's lair, save your game, then reload.  Awaken 
Queen by walking through the lair entrance.  The Queen can be damaged while 
frozen, but won't actually die until you "unfreeze" her.

View Alien Ending:
     Enable the "Banana Stops" cheat.  Must have at least one fully-grown 
cocoon.  Get killed.  When "Cocoon Hatching" appears, press Option+A or 
Option+B.

higher Challenges.  The Miracle Race will still be highlighted and can be 
played.

Spinout Bug:
     On any California Highway track, pause the game while driving through a 
puddle of water, then unpause.  You will be spinning at a speed proportional 
to how fast you were going when you paused.  You can speed up the spin by 
pressing the accelerator while spinning.

won't scroll, messages won't disappear, the SuperZapper might not work, and 
the web won't be solid-filled.  Entering the "Green Path" bonus round 
effectively ends your game.  Exiting the Jupiter River or LSD bonus rounds 
will occasionally mess up the double-buffering of the main game (though it 
corrects itself after you die or finish the level).
