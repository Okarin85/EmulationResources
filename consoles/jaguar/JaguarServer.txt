---------------------------------------------------
  The Jaguar Server project started out in August '94. The goal
  was to make a cheap developer kit for anyone that wanted to
  program for the Jaguar. Atari's own developer kit was $5500 and
  that was WAY to much if you just wanted to hack and program the
  Jaguar just for the fun of it.
  The very first prototype was built around the Mega ST's 'MegaBus'
  All of it was hand wired together using a total of 21 IC's.
  I can tell you that this board had VERY little empty space on it..
  This prototype was soon scraped, as I begun work on the Rev A
  board, using a different approach this time. It was built for the
  cartridge port and could then be used on all Atari computers not
  just the ones having a 'MegaBus'.
  To keep the cost down, I also decided to use the Jaguar's 2MB
  main memory and not include any expensive RAM chips in the Jaguar
  Server hardware.
  The Rev A board was up and running with very simple software in
  February '95. As the Rev A board had some small flaws, I made
  some changes to the layout and came up with the Rev B board.
  More serious work now begun on the Software - The Shell running
  on the Atari computer and the JagOS - Running on the Jaguar.

- General Info.                                   -
---------------------------------------------------
  * Use the Jaguar Server Kit to develop Jaguar programs !
  * The Jaguar Server runs on all Atari ST/STE/Falcon/TT computers.
  * The hardware plugs into your computers cartridge port. From the
    cartridge hardware goes a 40 pin ribbon cable into the Jaguar.
  * Uses a slightly modified standard Jaguar. Modificate your own
    Jaguar or send it to me, and I'll send it back to you.
  * You can change between 'modified' and 'original' Jaguar by the
    flick of a switch. A reset button is also installed.
    ABSOLUTELY _NO_ compatibility problems with Jaguar games.
  * No programming restrictions apart from a 2Mb main memory limit
    in the Jaguar. Future software updates will be able to upload
    data at the command of a running Jaguar program.
  * You use the Jaguar Server software to upload programs/data to
    the Jaguar. The software looks best in resolutions over 640*400.
  * Software updates to JagOS (Jaguar Operating System) are possible
    without burning a new EPROM chip simply by using newer software.
  * Upload transfer rate is currently 83 Kbytes per second on a 8 MHz
    Atari ST and 131 Kbytes per second running at 16 MHz.
  * Use the Devpac 3 assembler or any other code generator to write
    programs.
  * A remote debugger and RISC assembler is under development.
    The RISCY assembler are available for RISC assembler programming.
  * Software updates and info are available on Internet World Wide Web
    at HTTP://www-und.ida.liu.se/~t94patsa/jserver.html
    and by filerequest with any FidoNet compatible mailer to
    STacken BBS on FidoNet 2:204/219 under the magic name JSERVER
  * A Jaguar Server Developer Mailing list are available for
    programming discussions. NOT open for anyone.
    E-mail to nat@zumdick.rhein-main.de for more info on how to join.
  * The Jaguar Server development kit contains this...
           + Jaguar Server cartridge (hardware)
           + Jaguar Server Shell & JagOS (software)
           + Switches, ribbon cable, connectors and everything else
             that you need to start programming right away.
           + A few Jaguar (*.JAG) programs, utilities and example source code.
           + Klaus RISCY assembler.
           + Nat!´s excellent Underground Jaguar Technical Documentation.
  * IT DOES _NOT_ CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING... You have to get these
    things yourself....
           - No 68000 assembler.
           - No Atari corp. Jaguar utilitys or RISC assemblers.
  * 'Hacker' experience and good knowledge of assembler programming
    is STRONGLY recommended. Programming the Jaguar is done almost in 100%
    assembler.
| * The Jaguar Server is NOT licensed/connected to Atari Corp. in ANY way.
| * The Jaguar Server modification will void all Atari corp. warranty and will
|   definitely violate your license agreement in the U.S. and probably in every
|   other country to.
  * The Jaguar Server Development Kit price is :
    Jaguar Server Kit, do modification by yourself.
    1300 SKr, 290 DM, $190, GBP 125
    Jaguar Server Kit, Send Jaguar to me for modification.

- Some technical info.                            -
---------------------------------------------------
  A Jaguar (*.JAG) program is built around a header. There are
  currently seven different headers, each with it's own use
  and advantages depending on the development environment and
  programs.
  For example, one of the headers looks like this (for Devpac 3)
  *-----------------------------------------------------------------*
  * Standard JagOS 3 Upload & Run parameters.                       *
  * ½ Roine 950420                                                  *
  *-----------------------------------------------------------------*
    OUTPUT I:\*.JAG           * Output standard Atari Executable.
  down    EQU $5000           * Download address in Jaguar.
  start   EQU $5000           * Program start address in Jaguar.
          OPT   D-            * No debugging info.
          dc.b 'JAGR'         * Magic to skip Devpac Header.
          dc.w 3              * JagOS 3 - Receive & Run.
          dc.l down           * Download address.
          dc.l c_end-c_start  * Length of Jaguar Code.
                              * A dc.l 0 are also possible.
          dc.l start          * Start address.
          ORG  start          * If position dependent code.
  *-----------------------------------------------------------------
  c_start                     * Jaguar code start.....
          NOP
          NOP
          ILLEGAL             * Not much of a program...  Hmm...
  c_end                       * Jaguar code end.

- Jaguar Modification                             -
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-  You have to have previous experiance with soldering in order to  -
-             successfully install it in your Jaguar.               -
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- I will take NO responsibility if you for some reason damage your  -
-        Jaguar in any way when making this modification.           -
-  If you don't think you can handle it, you can always send your   -
-                   Jaguar to me for modification.                  -
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-        You will get all the things you need, including :          -
-    Finished curcuit board (tested), switches, wire, resistors,    -
-              IC-socket and flatcable with connectors.             -
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-     This is a breif outline on how to do the modification.        -
-     More info with pictures are availible at the WWW-site.        -
-     If you do not have access to WWW, I can fax it to you.        -
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Remove four screws from the bottom of the Jaguar. There are one in each
corner.
Lift off the plastic lid.
Bend up the small metal pins and remove the top shield.
Remove four screws that holds the curcuit board. Two located near the joypad
and two at the cartridge connector.
Lift up and separate the bottom shield, curcuit board and plastic bottom.
Drill two holes in the plastic lid for the switches with a 5 mm drill.
Remove the plastic 'knob' with the saw. This knob is removed because the
flatcable will later require this space.
Remove some more plastic to make space for the flatcable. Use knife and
saw.
Remove part of the top sheild to make room for the switches.
Remove part of the bottom sheild to make an exit for the flatcable.
Cut and _carefully_ bend up pins 22 and 24 on the Eprom.
Solder the 32 pin IC-socket on top of the Eprom. Place it high, so you have
more space to solder resistors.
Solder the resistors and connect the switches. Don't use longer
wire then required.
Solder the resetswitch.
Plug in the flatcable in the socket.
Tie up the cables for the switches with the two straps.
Assemble you Jaguar.
Test.
Finished!
