<h3><font color=#77ee77>What is the cartridge pin layout?</font></h3>
If the SNES doesn't detect the CIC while power is on, then it will not continue
to read the cartridge. Further details of this are not known to me.

BA0-BA7 switch between a possible 256 banks/pages.
</pre>
<p>
LoROM data is stored in the upper 32kbytes of the possible 64kbyte bank/page
(A15 is assumed high). Using 64kbyte pages, the SNES can address a huge 16Mbytes
or 128Mbits!
<p>
According to a SNES memory map, LoROM games can be as large as 16Mbit while
HiROM games are limited to 32Mbit... what about the 48Mbit game floating around?

<h3><font color=#77ee77>What is the ROM pin layout?</font></h3>
This pin layout was taken from a Donkey Kong Country 2 cartridge and seems to be
consistent with all their mask ROMs (some are 32pin, others 36pin).

<h3><font color=#77ee77>What is the DSP1 pin layout?</font></h3>
This was taken from a hacked Pilotwings cartridge with a switch on it - possibly
to select between HiROM and LoROM DSP1 games. I'm not 100% sure that the
following is correct or complete though.

<pre>
               Vcc   01   28   Vcc
               Vcc   02   27   A14 (A12 - used for HiROM?)

                nc   04   25   /RD
                nc   05   24   /WR
                D0   06   23   ?
                D1   07   22   ?
                D2   08   21   Vcc
                D3   09   20   Vcc
                D4   10   19   Vcc
                D5   11   18   Vcc
                D6   12   17   GND
                D7   13   16   /RESET (inverted RESET- SNES slot)
                D8   14   15   CLOCK?
</pre>

If you can verify/correct this, it would be greatly appreciated.

<h3><font color=#77ee77>What is the MAD-1 and its pin layout?</font></h3>
The MAD-1 stands for Memory Address Decoder revision 1. It is used on the Donkey
Kong Country (1 and 2) cartridge and possibly other cartridges in order to
address one or two ROMs and a static RAM.

<pre>
               /HI   01   16   /LO
               /SE   02   15   A13
                     03   14   A14
               /RE   04   13   BA5
               Vcc   05   12   A15
               Vcc   06   11   /CS (p49 SNES slot)
               Vcc   07   10   Vcc
               GND   08   09   RESET (p26 SNES slot)

/RE - /CS on a 32Mbit ROM (possibly for MAD-1a only)
/LO - /CS on ROM1 (lower 16mbit)
/HI - /CS on ROM2 (upper 16mbit)
/SE - /CS on Static RAM
</pre>

<h3><font color=#77ee77>What is the pin layout of the 16kbit SRAM most commonly used by Nintendo?</font></h3>
It seems that Nintendo uses this SRAM in many of their games, mainly because it
is very cheap, only $A5 (retail) - much cheaper for Nintendo who buys millions
of them. It can address up to 2048 bytes or 16kbits.

<pre>

<Font Color=#55FFAA><center><h1>Embedded Cartridge Information</h1></center></font>
Most of the information in this section was obtained from Mindrape's SNES ROM document, 
but also a result, of my own investigation.
<p>
All values are in decimal unless specified with a trailing 'h', indicating a 
hexadecimal value.
<p>
The starting offset for this information is located at the end of the first
page:
<pre>
<b>LoROM:</b> offset 32704
<b>HiROM:</b> offset 65472
</pre>
<h3><font color=#77ee77>Game title (21 bytes)</font></h3>

The title is in upper case on most games.

<h3><font color=#77ee77>ROM makeup (1 byte)</font></h3>

<b>Upper nibble (4 bits):</b>
<pre>
<b>Value ROM speed</b>
  0   SlowROM (200ns)
  3   FastROM (120ns)
</pre>
<b>Lower nibble (4 bits):</b>
<pre>
<b>Value Bank size</b>
  0   LoROM (32kb banks)
  1   HiROM (64kb banks)
</pre>

<h3><font color=#77ee77>ROM type (1 byte)</font></h3>
<pre>
<b>Byte ROM type</b>
 0   ROM only

</pre>

<h3><font color=#77ee77>ROM size (1 byte)</font></h3>
<pre>
<b>Byte ROM size</b>
 8    2 MegaBits
 9    4 MegaBits
 10   8 MegaBits
 11  16 MegaBits
 12  32 MegaBits
</pre>

At the time of writing, the largest SNES game is 48Mbit, while 8Mbit cartridges
are the most common. There are cartridge sizes of 10Mbit, 12Mbit, 20Mbit and
24Mbit, which are reported as 16Mbit, 16Mbit, 16Mbit and 32Mbit respectively.
<p>
Another way of calculating the ROM size is:  1 shl (ROMbyte-7) MegaBits

<h3><font color=#77ee77>SRAM size (1 byte)</font></h3>
<pre>
<b>Byte SRAM size</b>
 0   (none)
 1   16 KiloBits
 2   32 KiloBits
 3   64 KiloBits
</pre>
64 KiloBit SRAM's are the largest Nintendo uses (except DOOM?), while most
copiers have 256 kiloBits on-board.
<p>
Another way of calculating the SRAM size is:  1 shl (SRAMbyte+3) KiloBits

<h3><font color=#77ee77>Country (1 byte)</font></h3>

<h3><font color=#77ee77>Game Version (1 byte)</font></h3>

The version is stored as version 1.VersionByte and must be
less than 128. i.e. Less than 1.128.

<h3><font color=#77ee77>Inverse ROM Checksum (2 bytes)</font></h3>

This is the same as XORing the two checksum bytes. i.e. The
checksum bits are inversed.

<h3><font color=#77ee77>ROM Checksum (2 bytes)</font></h3>
The checksum is a 16bit word with the lower 8bits stored first, followed by the upper 8bits.
<P>
The checksum is calculated by dividing the ROM into 4Mbit
chunks then adding all the bytes in these chunks together.
Once you have the checksum for each chunk, add them together
and take the lower 32bits of the result.
<p>
With a non-standard image size, you do not get it equally
divisible by 4Mbit (excluding 2Mbit images). e.g. 10Mbit =
4Mbit + 4Mbit + 2Mbit chunks.
<p>
Therefore, you must create a 4Mbit chunk from what is left
over. Using the same example, you would add the checksum of
the following chunks to get the ROM checksum:
<p>
<center>
4Mbit + 4Mbit + (2Mbit + 2Mbit)<br>
or<br>
4Mbit + 4Mbit + (2 x 2Mbit)
</center>
                               
<h3><font color=#77ee77>Non Maskable Interrupt / VBL Vector (2 bytes)</font></h3>

<pre>
<b>LoROM:</b> at offset 33274
<b>HiROM:</b> at offset 66042
</pre>
<h3><font color=#77ee77>Reset Vector (2 bytes)</font></h3>

Where to start the ROM code.
<pre>
<b>LoROM:</b> at offset 33276
<b>HiROM:</b> at offset 66042
</pre>
<h3><font color=#77ee77>How do I know if the ROM is HiROM or LoROM?</font></h3>

When you OR the checksum bytes of a disk image and the inverse
checksum bytes, the result should be FFFF hex. Therefore, to
detect whether an image is HiROM or LoROM, you must read those
bytes, OR them, and see if they equal FFFF hex.
<p>
The ROM's type depends at which location the OR'd bytes equal
FFFF hex. If it isn't found at either location, then the other
way of checking is to see at which location the title contains
uppercase alphanumeric characters. (But this fails with most
Japanese cartridges)
<p>
Why don't you use the ROM Makeup Byte? You can, and some
utilities do, but some utilities allow you to change this
byte, so incorrect results may occur.
<p>
For the actual ROM, the embedded cartridge information is
stored at the same position for both LoROM and HiROM. In this
case, you must use the ROM Makeup Byte or read a 64kb page and
see if both 32kb chunks (upper and lower 32kb) are the same.
If they are the same, it is LoROM (32kb pages - A15 is not
used, the data repeats itself) otherwise it is HiROM.
<p>
As a general rule of thumb, if you can't detect which ROM type
it is, default to LoROM, as these are the most common of
cartridges.

<p><A NAME="cheatdevice"><br><br>
<Font Color=#55FFAA><center><h1>Cheat Device Decoding</h1></center></font>

We'll start with the easiest first then work our way down.
These codes work by replacing a byte at a specific location in
the ROM.
<p>
E.g. In the game F-Zero, at a particular position in the ROM,
there is a number 3 indicating 3 lives to start off with. What
a cheat code will do is replace this byte with, let's say, the
number 9, so now when the game is run, the player starts off
with 9 lives.

<h3><font color=#77ee77>Pro Action Replay (hardware)</font></h3>

<pre>
Code format:        AAAAAADD            (8 digits)

A - Address
D - Data
</pre>
These codes are in Hex, the address being a CPU address, not a
direct ROM location (more about this later).

<h3><font color=#77ee77>Gold Finger (software)</font></h3>
<pre>
Code format:        AAAAADDDDDDCCW      (14 digits)

A - Address
D - Data
C - Checksum
W - What to change (DRAM or SRAM)
</pre>
This code was designed for the copiers, and are straight Hex
characters. Therefore the Address is a ROM address, not a CPU
address. Data bytes are arranged in 2 characters (2 D's per
byte), which allows for 3 bytes. If a byte is not being used,
it is denoted by 'XX'. I have never seen a code with three
unused bytes - what's the point of one anyhow?
<p>
The address (A's) is a base address. The first data byte (D's)
is to be placed at this address. The second at address+1, the
third at address+2 (if to be used, that is, if they are not
'XX').
<p>
To calculate the checksum you must take the A's and D's, add a
zero (0) to the front of the shortened code, then divide into
block's of 2 hex digits (bytes). Add these hex digits together
(2 characters per hex digit) then minus 160 hex (352 decimal).
Now AND this number by FF hex (255 decimal) to get the lower 8
bits (byte). Convert this number to hex and you have your
checksum (C's).
<p>
<em>W</em> tells the copier whether to replace the byte in the DRAM
(ROM image) or the SRAM (Saved game static RAM) of the copier.
<pre>
<b>Value of W  Where to place byte</b>
    0       DRAM (ROM image)
    1       SRAM (Saved game image)
</pre>
The rec.games.video FAQ specifies that there may be non-
standard values of 2, 8, A, C, F for W, which may be converted
to 0. I personally have only seen Gold Finger codes with W = 0.

<h3><font color=#77ee77>Game Genie (hardware)</font></h3>
<pre>
Code format:        DDAA-AAAA      (8 digits)

A - Address
D - Data
</pre>
This is the most difficult code to decipher out of the lot. It
is as follows:
<p>
First take the code in the form xxxx-xxxx and take out the
dash ('-') to form xxxxxxxx. Convert these characters (Genie
Hex) to normal hex characters using the following table:
<pre>
<b>Genie Hex:  </b>  D  F  4  7  0  9  1  5  6  B  C  8  A  2  3  E
<b>Normal  Hex:</b>  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F
</pre>
The first two characters is the data byte in Hex. Now take the
other 6 following characters (encoded address) and put it into
it's binary form of 24 bits.
<p>
Now take each bit of the encoded address and rearrange to form
the real address:
<pre>
24bit encoded address: ijklqrst opabcduv wxefghmn
8bit encoded data:     ABCDEFGH
</pre>
Rearrange as:
<pre>
<b>24bit address             : 8bit data</b>
abcdefgh ijklmnop qrstuvwx: ABCDEFGH
MSB                    LSB  MSB  LSB
</pre>
Bit 23 of the encoded address (bit 15 of the real address) is
always 1. The reason being that the SNES CPU address must be 1
for it to access the ROM.

<h3><font color=#77ee77>Converting between CPU addresses and ROM addresses</font></h3>

This is very easy once you understand how it is done. To
convert from a CPU address to a ROM address, all you need to
do is remove bit 15. By doing this, I don't mean just setting
it to 0. I mean by removing it, then moving all bits after it
down one.
<pre>
e.g. ROMaddress = (CPUaddress and 7FFFh) or ((CPUaddress and FF0000h) shl 1)
</pre>
Therefore, to convert from a ROM address to a CPU address, you
must insert a high bit into position 15 (bit 15).
<pre>
e.g. CPUaddress = (ROMaddress and 7FFFh) or ((ROMaddress and 7F8000h) shr 1) or 8000h
</pre>

<h3><font color=#77ee77>Easily converting between codes</font></h3>

I have made available two DOS programs with source code 
which allow you to convert between Game Genie and
Gold Finger codes. These are available freely from the
<A HREF="http://tgi.home.ml.org/console/SNES/codes.html">Turtle Group Inc</A>.
<p>
Note: Because the Gold Finger can only address upto 8Mbit of
game data, while other codes can address upto 64Mbit of game
data, some Game Genie and Action Replay codes may not be
converted to Gold Finger.

<p><A NAME="snescopiers"><br><br>
<Font Color=#55FFAA><center><h1>SNES Copiers</h1></center></font>

<h3><font color=#77ee77>What are copiers?</font></h3>

A copier is a device which sits on top of the SNES and allows
you to backup your cartridges as well as play your backed up
games. It does this by storing the ROM image of a cartridge to
floppy disks via a 1.44Mb disk drive. Most copiers also
include a parallel PC port interface, allowing your PC to
control the unit and store images on your hard drive.
<p>
Copier's contain DRAM from 1 Megabyte to 16 Megabytes,
8MegaBits to 128MegaBits respectively. This is the reason why
they are so expensive.
<p>
It is legal to own and use a copier for your own personal
backup of cartridges which you legally own in this point in
time, although it is illegal to distribute this copy (only one
copy is allowed). This may vary depending on where you live.
<p>
If you wish to make your own "home brew" copier for the SNES, and
other consoles, more information can be found at the
<A HREF="http://tgi.home.ml.org/console/CartDisk/">

<h3><font color=#77ee77>Super Wild Card (SWC) header information</font></h3>

The SWC (Super Wild Card) image format consists of a 512 byte
header. It's layout is as follows (set unused bytes to 00h):
<pre>
<b>Offset Function</b>
  0    Lower 8 bits of size word
  1    Upper 8 bits of size word
  2    Image information byte
  8    SWC header identifier (set to AAh)
  9    SWC header identifier (set to BBh)
 10    SWC header identifier (set to 04h)
</pre>
The size word is calculated by multiplying the image size, not
game size (in MegaBits) by 16. e.g. Image is 4 Mbits, so size
word would be 4*16=64.
<p>
Image information byte (in the form of 76543210):
<pre>
<b>Bit  Description</b>
7    1 - Run program in Mode 0 (JMP $8000)
     0 - Run program in Mode 1 (JMP RESET Vector)
6    1 - Multi image (there is another split file to follow)
     0 - Not multi image (no more split files to follow)
5    1 - SRAM memory mapping Mode 21 (HiROM)
     0 - SRAM memory mapping Mode 20
4    1 - DRAM memory mapping Mode 21 (HiROM)
     0 - DRAM memory mapping Mode 20
3/2  00: 256kbit SRAM
     01: 65kbit SRAM
     10: 16kbit SRAM
     11: no SRAM
1/0  reserved
</pre>

<h3><font color=#77ee77>Pro Fighter (FIG) header format</font></h3>

This format is similar to the SWC. It consists of a 512byte
header who's layout is as follows (set unused bytes to 00h):
<pre>
<b>Offset Function</b>
  0    Lower 8 bits of size word
  1    Upper 8 bits of size word
  2    40h - Multi image
       00h - Last image in set (or single image)
  3    80h - if HiROM
       00h - if LoROM
  4    If using DSP1 microchip:
           FDh - If using SRAM (SRAM size>0)
           47h - If no SRAM (SRAM size=0)
       77h - If not using DSP1 and no SRAM (SRAM size=0)
  5    If using DSP1 microchip:
           82h - If using SRAM (SRAM size>0)
           83h - If no SRAM (SRAM size=0)
       83h - If not using DSP1 and no SRAM (SRAM size=0)
</pre>
<h3><font color=#77ee77>Game Doctor file name format</font></h3>

The Game Doctor does not use a 512 byte header like the SWC,
instead it uses specially designed filenames to distinguish
between multi files. I'm not sure if it used the filename for
information about the size of the image though.
<p>
Usually, the filename is in the format of: SFXXYYYZ.078
<p>
Where SF means Super Famicon, XX refers to the size of the
image in Mbit. If the size is only one character (i.e. 2, 4 or
8 Mbit) then no leading "0" is inserted.
<p>
YYY refers to a catalogue number in Hong Kong shops
identifying the game title. (0 is Super Mario World, 1 is F-
Zero, etc). I was told that the Game Doctor copier produces a
random number when backing up games.
<p>
Z indicates a multi file. Like XX, if it isn't used it's
ignored.
<p>
A would indicate the first file, B the second, etc. I am told
078 is not needed, but is placed on the end of the filename by
systems in Asia.
<p>
e.g. The first 16Mbit file of Donkey Kong Country (assuming it
  is cat. no. 475) would look like:  SF16475A.078

<h3><font color=#77ee77>Super Wild Card parallel port I/O protocol</font></h3>
<P>I was given this information a while ago. It is supposed to be direct from the company which makes SWC's and I have included this information because a few people have been asking for it. If you have similar information for other backup devices, it would be appreciated if you could send it to me.

<p><A NAME="romprotection"><br><br>
<Font Color=#55FFAA><center><h1>ROM Protection Schemes</h1></center></font>

This section details ways of bypassing the FastROM, PAL/NTSC
and SRAM size checks implemented in many SNES games in order
to stop people backing them up using copiers.
<p>
Note: You don't necessarily have to find and replace all
strings to remove the check(s).

<h3><font color=#77ee77>SlowROM checks</font></h3>

Most cartridges these days use 120ns ROM in order to get the
most out of the ageing SNES. However, there are still many
copiers around which emulate ROM at speeds of 200ns meaning
they cannot backup the newer cartridges correctly.
<p>
Changing the ROM code to bypass the SlowROM check, found in
many, but not all FastROM games, allows many people with
SlowROM copiers to backup FastROM games.
<p>
To patch a ROM and bypass the SlowROM check, you must find any
of the following strings in the image and replace it with the
patch string: (all codes in hex)

<pre>
<b>Search for          Replace with</b>

</pre>

<h3><font color=#77ee77>PAL/NTSC checks</font></h3>

Most SNES games have code which detects which video system the
cartridge is being played on and refuses to run if not in the
right mode. This is to stop people from buying games from
other countries before they are released locally.
<p>
To bypass the PAL/NTSC check the following patterns must be
found and replaced with the ones specified: (all codes in hex)

<pre>
<b>Search for                Replace with</b>

<h3><font color=#77ee77>SRAM size checks</font></h3>

Some SNES games check to see how much SRAM is connected to the
SNES as a form of copy protection. As most copiers have
256kbits standard, the game will know it's running on a backup
unit and stop to prevent people copying the games. However,
the newer copiers get around this detection somehow.
<p>
To disable the SRAM size check in a ROM image, search for the
following and replace as appropriate.
<p>
Note: All codes are in hex, although 'xx' means anything,
while a comma means search for either of the two or more
(enclosed in brackets).
<pre>
<b>Search for</b>     (8F, 9F) xx xx 70 (CF, DF) xx xx 70 D0

<p>
The format is as follows:
<pre>
<b>   Description                    Size</b>
IPS file identifier            5 bytes (characters PATCH)
Offset in file to place patch  3 bytes
